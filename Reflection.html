            <p style="font-size:16px">During the duration of this assignment I had faced a couple of challenges that made it difficult for me to progress the top challenges I had faced were inserting images into the coloum section I struggled alot with this issue because the image was not was not fitting the width of the image was being streched across all of the three coloums and the image was cropped in half due to the height settings of the coloum in the css.</p>
            <p style="font-size:16px">Another challenge that i had faced is with the contact sheet although the template of that sheet was used from W3Schools when put the code into my html and css it did not align properly and there were a few variables missing and also the dorp down menue was not working, this was a difficult challenge.</p>

            <p style="font-size:25px">How I Overcame challenges</p>
            <p style="font-size:16px">
                The first challenge regarding the profile image I was able to overcome by adjusting the css of the image and the coloum. I started off by edditing the css of the coloum trying to find the correct width and after a couple of tryal and errors I was able to find the code that would work out which was width:  33.33333vw, the second edit i had made to the css coloum was include a flex-glow: 1 which controls the growth of the flex items and when it is set to 1 the coloum will be able to grow and fill the flex container. After these changes i had done the only other changes that I had made were for the image which because the height was the only issue left for the height i changed the value to 100% instead of 100px which had resolved the issue.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:16px">For the second challenge that i had faced regarding the layout of the contact sheet i needed to re arrange a few things such as the select button for this button i needed to change the colour options in the css document as when i first put the button in html and the styling in css it there was no colour I soon found out that the colour styling was not in the css and then after i added this it was working. Within the contact sheet the country box did not show all the countries that i needed to resolve this I added the option tag and included all the countried i needed.
